# What is MongoDB:
* MongoDB is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model.

* MongoDB is one of several database types to arise in the mid-2000s under the NoSQL banner. Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, MongoDB is built on an architecture of collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of key-value pairs and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function as the equivalent of relational database tables

* Like other NoSQL databases, MongoDB supports dynamic schema design, allowing the documents in a collection to have different fields and structures. The database uses a document storage and data interchange format called BSON, which provides a binary representation of JSON-like documents. Automatic sharding enables data in a collection to be distributed across multiple systems for horizontal scalability as data volumes increase.

# MongoDB for Node.js Developers
* This course is for learning mongo DB from scratch with Node.js.

# Prerequisites:
* Should be comfortable with use of callbacks in JavaScript.

# About this course
* Learn everything you need to know to get started building a MongoDB-based app. This course will go over basic installation, JSON, schema design, querying, insertion of data, indexing and working with the mongoose. 

# Objective
* After completing this course, you should have a good understanding as to how applications are built on top of MongoDB using Node.js

# Course Duration:
* This is 8 weeks course. This is divided into 3 levels.
