# MongoDB4Node.jsDevelopers
This course is for learning mongoDB from scratch with for Node.js Developers

# Prerquisites:
* Basic Java script 
* Relational database understanding (any of MSSQL, MYSql, Oracle)

# What is MongoDB:
* MongoDB is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model.

* MongoDB is one of several database types to arise in the mid-2000s under the NoSQL banner. Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, MongoDB is built on an architecture of collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of key-value pairs and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function as the equivalent of relational database tables

* Like other NoSQL databases, MongoDB supports dynamic schema design, allowing the documents in a collection to have different fields and structures. The database uses a document storage and data interchange format called BSON, which provides a binary representation of JSON-like documents. Automatic sharding enables data in a collection to be distributed across multiple systems for horizontal scalability as data volumes increase.
